Given a linked list, determine if it has cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list. we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

## 1. Example:

**Example 1**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

**Intuition**

To detect if a list is syclic, we can check whether a node had been visited before. A natural way is to use hash table.

**Algorithm**

We go through each node one by one and record each node's reference (or memory address) in a hash table. If the current node is `null`, we have reached the end of the list and it must not be a syclic. If the current node's reference is in the hash table, then return true.

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        //Hash Table方法
        //数据都是通过数组或者链表存储的，但是在判断一些性质的时候，我们可以使用其他数据结构来辅助
        Set<ListNode> nodeSeen = new HashSet<>();
        while(head != null){
            if(nodeSeen.contains(head)){
                return true;
            }else{
                nodeSeen.add(head);
                head = head.next;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Analysis 2

- Time complexity: `O(n)`. 

- Space complexity: `O(n)`. The space depends on the number of elements added to the hash table, which contains at most n elements.

**Intuition**

Imagine two runners running on a track at different speed. What happens when the track is actually a circle?

**Algorithm**

The space complexity can be reduced to O(1) by considering two pointers at different speed - a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The slow pointer move one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        //边界处理
        if(head == null || head.next == null){
            return false;
        }
        
        ListNode fast = head.next;
        ListNode slow = head;

        //经典while - if
        while(fast != null && fast.next != null 
                && fast.next.next != null && fast != slow){
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        if(fast == slow){
            return true;
        }else{
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

### Analysis 2

- Time complexity: `O(1)`.
- Space complexity: `O(n)`.
